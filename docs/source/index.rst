sage_language documentation
===========================


The `sage_language` package is designed to handle language localization through cookies in a Django application. It provides middleware that enables automatic locale switching based on the user's language preference stored in cookies. The package integrates seamlessly with Djangoâ€™s built-in internationalization (i18n) framework, making it easy to develop multilingual applications. 

With `sage_language`, you can set up language switching in a simple, flexible way, allowing users to change the display language of your site dynamically. It supports cookie-based language persistence across sessions, giving you full control over the language experience.

In this documentation, you will find information on how to install, configure, and use `sage_language`, along with detailed examples and best practices for handling multilingual content in Django.
